        <p>Scoopy is a fictitious Ice Cream shop where we can pic and create our personalized ice cream through their website. The brand's tone of voice is fun and informal, using bright colors and a round typeface. The process to create an ice cream is very simple and explained on the home page.  After that, the user can pay virtually and will receive an order number to get his ice cream from the shop. </p>
