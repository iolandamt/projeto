        <h2>Hi there! Nice to meet you!</h2>
        <p>I am an aspiring Product Designer with a passion to create meaningful designs and bring solutions to user's problems. I enjoy every step of my work process, from User research and listening, to the final interface design. I am also interested in Illustration, Animation and Branding Design. I consider myself a hard-working person, with good communication skills and that always tries to bring creative ideas to the table. A good work environment is very important for me and I always feel inspired and motivated when I'm working with a team with different backgrounds and areas of knowledge.</p>
