<h1>Hello there!</h1>
<p>I'm Rita, a Product Designer focused on creating meaningful human-centered digital experiences.</p>
<p>I work on end-to-end projects, from research and problem recognition, to visual design, prototyping and testing. I also want to keep developing in other fields such as illustration, branding and motion.
With a curious, responsible and creative mindset, Iâ€™m ready to improve, work with new people and give my best in every challenge.</p>
<p>Let's create together!</p>
